            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p id="intro">I've lived in a lot of places. Before my mother remarried and settled with my stepfather in the St. Louis area, 
                we lived with my dad who was in the Air Force for a while, 
                then got a job in the Foreign Service department of the US State Dept.</p>

            <h3>Landstuhl, Germany</h3>
            <img src="images/landstuhl.jpeg" alt="A nice picture of the Landstuhl skyline" height="300px">
            <article id="landstuhl">This is where I was born, on May 7, 1992. 
                My father was in the US Air Force at the time, and I was born at the Landstuhl Air Force base. 
                I don't have many memories of my time here, since we only lived here for a couple of years.</article>

            <h3>Karachi, Pakistan</h3>
            <img src="images/karachi.jpg" alt="A nice picture of the Karachi skyline" height="300px">
            <article id="karachi">My first big international culture shock came when we moved here from Virginia. 
                I started fourth grade here, and I attended an international school which was unlike any school I'd been to in the States. 
                I was the only American student in my fourth grade class, and the only thing that bothered me about that was that nobody ever wanted to play baseball during recess. 
                Living in Karachi was more dangerous for me than I knew at the time. 9/11 happened while I was there, and it changed everything almost instantly. 
                We evacuated about a week after the attacks, and moved back to Virginia, where it was significantly safer.

            <h3>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia</h3>
            <img src="images/addis-ababa.jpg" alt="A nice picture of the Addis Ababa skyline" height="300px">
            <article id="addis-ababa">After we moved back from Karachi, my dad was eventually reassigned to a safer country, and we moved to Ethiopia. 
                In Addis Ababa, I attended another international school and spent my entire fifth grade year here. 
                Our house was enormous, and we even had an in-house staff this time around. 
                Yimi, our staff lead, would cook our meals and do most of the cleaning, while the other staff did things like laundry and maintenance in the little buildings at the back of the property. 
                Our property was also walled and the gate had a guard post. My siblings and I would make friends with the guards sometimes.
